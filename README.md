![HarvestAI](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fae76437-68cd-4203-b770-61836dc4102b)

HarvestAI is an innovative platform that enables users to create and deploy autonomous AI agents for yield farming on the Solana blockchain. Our infrastructure leverages cutting-edge AI technologies to revolutionize how investors interact with decentralized finance.

## Harvest Launchpad

The Harvest Launchpad is the core of our infrastructure, allowing users to create customizable AI agents for yield farming:

- **User-Friendly Creation**: Design your AI agent with an intuitive interface, no coding required.
- **Secure Fund Management**: Deposit SOL or USDC into protected vaults managed by AI agents.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Fine-tune your agent with 9 key parameters:

1. **Risk Tolerance** (1-10): Determines the agent's risk appetite.
2. **Investment Horizon**: Short-term (<3 months), medium-term (3-12 months), or long-term (>12 months).
3. **Liquidity Preference**: High (stablecoins, established tokens) or low (emerging tokens).
4. **Market Condition Focus**: Strategies for bull, bear, or volatile markets.
5. **Profit Distribution Schedule**: Daily, weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly.
6. **Diversification Strategy**: Conservative, balanced, or aggressive allocation.
7. **Social Sentiment Sensitivity**: Threshold for actions based on market sentiment.
8. **Automated Rebalancing Frequency**: Daily, weekly, or monthly portfolio adjustments.
9. **Risk Mitigation Techniques**: Stop-loss orders, dynamic asset allocation, etc.

- **Interactive Experience**: Communicate with your agent through a dedicated text interface.

## Yield Farming Capabilities

HarvestAI's AI agents focus on liquidity provision (LP) and yield farming to generate revenue for their creators and vault depositors:

- **Liquidity Provision**: AI agents supply assets to Automated Market Makers (AMMs) on Solana, such as Raydium, Orca, and Saber, creating LP tokens.
- **Yield Farming**: Agents stake LP tokens in farming pools to earn additional rewards.
- **Dynamic Pool Selection**: Agents continuously analyze and shift assets to the highest-yielding LP pools and farms based on current market conditions and risk parameters.
- **Compounding**: Automatically reinvest earned rewards to maximize returns.
- **Revenue Sharing**: Profits generated from yield farming are distributed between the agent's creator and vault depositors according to predefined parameters.
- **Risk Management**: Agents monitor impermanent loss and adjust positions to optimize risk-adjusted returns.
- **Multi-Pool Strategy**: Diversify across multiple LP pools to balance risk and reward.

## AI Technology Stack

HarvestAI utilizes advanced AI technologies to power its agents:

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Enables intuitive user-agent communication.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Agents learn and adapt strategies based on market performance.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Predicts market trends and optimal entry/exit points.
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Allows collaborative decision-making among multiple AI agents.
- **Federated Learning**: Improves agent performance while maintaining data privacy.
